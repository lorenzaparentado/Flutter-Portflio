With four years of experience in computer science, which began in high school, I have maintained a high college GPA of 3.87 and great academic standards. I enjoy working on projects in my free time and have participated in three hackathons, winning one of them.\n\nCurrently, I am on a co-op at Neuroflow as a Flutter mobile engineer, working part-time as I start school. Initially, I focused on mobile development, creating new features and implementing existing ones onto Flutter. Now, I am working on backend development and plan to develop into a full-stack engineer.\n\nOutside of coding, I have a variety of interests. As a musician, I play around five instruments, including guitar, saxophone, ukulele, flute, and a bit of piano. As an athlete, I enjoy running almost every morning and working out every afternoon. I also embrace my nerdy side by playing video games, especially open-world RPGs like the Fallout series and Cyberpunk, and I enjoy watching movies and TV shows.";

I connected with the company because of its mission to “create a happier and healthier world,” which resonated with my desire to make a positive impact through my work.\n\nIn my first three months, I focused solely on mobile development. During this time, I learned Flutter, Swift for iOS development, and Kotlin for Android development. I also familiarized myself with industry standards for mobile apps, ensuring my code was clean, up-to-date, and well-tested. I worked on multiple projects, including a PDF viewer for users’ homework, the settings and notifications page, and the onboarding flow.";
  static const String workText2 =
      "For the past three months, I have been working on the backend. I learned Flask for our web app and SQL for our database. My tasks have included optimizing API calls to improve app performance, fixing bugs across the full stack to ensure a good user experience, and creating AWS Lambdas. As I continue to learn more about our codebase, I plan to delve into our frontend development as well.\n\nBeyond technical skills, I have gained many other valuable skills. I have learned how to collaborate effectively with other engineers and maintain a high-quality product together. Working in a multi-faceted team that includes Design, QA, Product, and all engineers has taught me about the various roles involved in developing a software product. Additionally, I have learned Agile methodology and Scrum, which have improved my ability to work with and interact with others.";
