I connected with the company because of its mission to “create a happier and healthier world,” which resonated with my desire to make a positive impact through my work.\n\nIn my first three months, I focused solely on mobile development. During this time, I learned Flutter, Swift for iOS development, and Kotlin for Android development. I also familiarized myself with industry standards for mobile apps, ensuring my code was clean, up-to-date, and well-tested. I worked on multiple projects, including a PDF viewer for users’ homework, the settings and notifications page, and the onboarding flow."),

I have learned how to collaborate effectively with other engineers and maintain a high-quality product together. Working in a multi-faceted team that includes Design, QA, Product, and all engineers has taught me about the various roles involved in developing a software product. Additionally, I have learned Agile methodology and Scrum, which have improved my ability to work with and interact with others."),
