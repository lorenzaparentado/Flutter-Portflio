                  "Hey Iâ€™m Lorenz, a third-year Computer Science major at Drexel University, pursuing a minor in Data Science with concentrations in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. With four years of experience in computer science, which began in high school, I have maintained a high college GPA of 3.87 and great academic standards. I enjoy working on projects in my free time and have participated in three hackathons, winning one of them.\n\nCurrently, I am on a co-op at Neuroflow as a Flutter mobile engineer, working part-time as I start school. Initially, I focused on mobile development, creating new features and implementing existing ones onto Flutter. Now, I am working on backend development and plan to develop into a full-stack engineer.\n\nOutside of coding, I have a variety of interests. As a musician, I play around five instruments, including guitar, saxophone, ukulele, flute, and a bit of piano. As an athlete, I enjoy running almost every morning and working out every afternoon. I also embrace my nerdy side by playing video games, especially open-world RPGs like the Fallout series and Cyberpunk, and I enjoy watching movies and TV shows.")),
